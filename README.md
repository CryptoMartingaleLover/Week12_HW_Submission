The document for this homework assignment can be found in Week12_HW_Submission -> Starter_Code -> crypto_sentiment.ipynb

In this assignment, we applied natural language processing to understand the sentiment in the latest news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. We also applied fundamental NLP techniques to better understand the other factors involved with the coin prices such as common words and phrases and organizations and entities mentioned in the articles.

We completed the following tasks:

1. [Sentiment Analysis](#1---Sentiment-Analysis)
2. [Natural Language Processing](#2---Natural-Language-Processing)
3. [Named Entity Recognition](#3---Named-Entity-Recognition)

One minor point of confusion I want to address is that the three questions at the end of the first section on sentiment analysis were a little confusing. I connected with Ask BCS, and the learning assistant said that for the 3rd question, I should use the max row to respond... but she wasn't 100% sure that that was correct.
